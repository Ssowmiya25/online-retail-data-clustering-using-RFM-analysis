1. Null values present in customer id

`df.describe()`


![describe](./Image/describe.png)

- Insight
1. Quantity column has minimum value -80995
2. Price column has minimum value  -11062.06

### Data Cleaning

1. InvoiceNo: Invoice number. Nominal. A 6-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each transaction. If this code starts with the letter 'c', it indicates a cancellation.

`df["Invoice"].str.replace("[0-9]" , "",regex = True).unique()`
- But has array(['', 'C', 'A'], dtype=object)

```python
cleaned_df = df.copy()
cleaned_df["Invoice"] = cleaned_df["Invoice"].astype("str")
mask = (
    cleaned_df["Invoice"].str.match("^\\d{6}$") == True
)
cleaned_df = cleaned_df[mask]

cleaned_df
```
![invoice clean](./Image/invoice%20clean.png)

2. StockCode: Product (item) code. Nominal. A 5-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each distinct product.

```python
df["StockCode"] = df["StockCode"].astype("str")

code=df[(df["StockCode"].str.match("^\\d{5}$")==False) & (df["StockCode"].str.match("^\\d{5}[a-zA-Z]+$")== False)]["StockCode"].unique()
code
```
- array(['POST', 'D', 'C2', 'DOT', 'M', 'BANK CHARGES', 'S', 'AMAZONFEE',
       'DCGS0076', 'DCGS0003', 'gift_0001_40', 'DCGS0070', 'm',
       'gift_0001_50', 'gift_0001_30', 'gift_0001_20', 'DCGS0055',
       'DCGS0072', 'DCGS0074', 'DCGS0069', 'DCGS0057', 'DCGSSBOY',
       'DCGSSGIRL', 'gift_0001_10', 'PADS', 'DCGS0004', 'DCGS0073',
       'DCGS0071', 'DCGS0066P', 'DCGS0068', 'DCGS0067', 'B', 'CRUK'],
      dtype=object)

- But Stockcode column has differnt number rather than the 5-digit integral number

```python
cleaned_df["StockCode"] = cleaned_df["StockCode"].astype("str")

mask = (
    (cleaned_df["StockCode"].str.match("^\\d{5}$") == True)
    | (cleaned_df["StockCode"].str.match("^\\d{5}[a-zA-Z]+$") == True)
    | (cleaned_df["StockCode"].str.match("^PADS$") == True)
)

cleaned_df = cleaned_df[mask]

cleaned_df
```

### Feature Engineering

`cleaned_df["SalesLineTotal"] = cleaned_df["Quantity"]*cleaned_df["Price"]`

### RFM Analysis Overview

###### RFM Analysis is a concept used by Data Science professionals, especially in the marketing domain for understanding and segmenting customers based on their buying behaviour.

###### Using RFM Analysis, a business can assess customersâ€™:

1. recency (the date they made their last purchase)
2. frequency (how often they make purchases)
3. monetary value (the amount spent on purchases)

- Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value of a customer are three key metrics that provide information about customer engagement, loyalty, and value to a business.

``` python
aggregated_df = cleaned_df.groupby(by = "Customer ID" , as_index=False) .agg(
         MonetaryValue=("SalesLineTotal","sum"),
         Frequency = ("Invoice","nunique"),
         LastInvoiceDate=("InvoiceDate","max")
     )
aggregated_df.head(5)
```
```python
max_invoice_date = aggregated_df["LastInvoiceDate"].max()
aggregated_df["Recency"] = (max_invoice_date - aggregated_df["LastInvoiceDate"]).dt.days
aggregated_df.head(5)
```

1. Presence of Outliers

### Handling Outliers
```python
M_Q1=aggregated_df["MonetaryValue"].quantile(0.25)
M_Q3=aggregated_df["MonetaryValue"].quantile(0.75)
M_IQR = M_Q3-M_Q1
monetary_outliers_df = aggregated_df[(aggregated_df["MonetaryValue"]>(M_Q3 + 1.5*M_IQR)) |(aggregated_df["MonetaryValue"]<(M_Q1 - 1.5*M_IQR))]
monetary_outliers_df.describe()

F_Q1=aggregated_df["Frequency"].quantile(0.25)
F_Q3=aggregated_df["Frequency"].quantile(0.75)
F_IQR = F_Q3-F_Q1
frequency_outliers_df = aggregated_df[(aggregated_df["Frequency"]>(F_Q3 + 1.5*F_IQR)) |(aggregated_df["Frequency"]<(F_Q1 - 1.5*F_IQR))]
frequency_outliers_df.describe()

non_outliers_df = aggregated_df[(~aggregated_df.index.isin(monetary_outliers_df.index)) & (~aggregated_df.index.isin(frequency_outliers_df.index))]

non_outliers_df.describe()
```

### Evaluation

1. Determine optimal K using the Elbow Method.
2. Silhouette Score

```python
max_k =12

inertia =[]
silhoutte_scores =[]
k_values = range(2,max_k+1)

for k in k_values:

    kmeans=KMeans(n_clusters=k,random_state=42,max_iter=1000)
    cluster_labels = kmeans.fit_predict(scaled_data_df)
    sil_score=silhouette_score(scaled_data_df,cluster_labels)
    silhoutte_scores.append(sil_score)
    inertia.append(kmeans.inertia_)
    
plt.figure(figsize=(14,6))
plt.subplot(1,2,1)
plt.plot(k_values,inertia,marker='o')
plt.title('KMeans Inertia for different values of k')
plt.xlabel('Number of Cluster (k)')

- Insights

**1. Cluster 0 (Blue): "Loyal Retainers"**

* Rationale: This cluster consists of high-value customers who make regular purchases, though their recent activity may vary. They are loyal, but it's crucial to keep their engagement high.
* Action: Implement retention strategies such as exclusive rewards, personalized offers, and regular communications to keep them loyal and maintain their spending habits.

  
**2.Cluster 1 (Orange): "Re-Engagement Targets"**

* Rationale: This group comprises customers who have lower purchase frequency and have not bought recently. Their spending has dropped, so the priority is bringing them back into the fold.
* Action: Re-engage through targeted campaigns, special offers, email reminders, or time-sensitive promotions to reignite their interest and increase purchasing activity.
  
**3.Cluster 2 (Green): "Growth Potential"**

* Rationale: These customers are less frequent and lower-value buyers, but they have recently made a purchase. They might be new or need nurturing to foster future spending.
* Action: Focus on relationship-building by offering excellent customer service, educational content, and incentives to increase their engagement and conversion into more frequent buyers.
  
**3.Cluster 3 (Red): "Top Performers"**

* Rationale: This cluster represents the highest-value customers who make frequent purchases and remain actively engaged. They are your most loyal and profitable segment.
* Action: Provide exclusive offers, loyalty bonuses, and VIP treatment to keep them engaged. Recognize their loyalty to further strengthen their bond with the brand.
  
**Summary of Cluster Names:**

* Cluster 0 (Blue): "Loyal Retainers"
* Cluster 1 (Orange): "Re-Engagement Targets"
* Cluster 2 (Green): "Growth Potential"
* Cluster 3 (Red): "Top Performers"

#### Segmenting the outlier customer
```python
overlap_indices = monetary_outliers_df.index.intersection(frequency_outliers_df.index)

monetary_only_outliers = monetary_outliers_df.drop(overlap_indices)
frequency_only_outliers = frequency_outliers_df.drop(overlap_indices)
monetary_and_frequency_outliers = monetary_outliers_df.loc[overlap_indices]

monetary_only_outliers["Cluster"] = -1
frequency_only_outliers["Cluster"] = -2
monetary_and_frequency_outliers["Cluster"] = -3

outlier_clusters_df = pd.concat([monetary_only_outliers, frequency_only_outliers, monetary_and_frequency_outliers])

- Insights

**Cluster -1 (Monetary Outliers) â€“ "Elite Spenders"**

* Characteristics: These customers make large but infrequent purchases, meaning they have a high monetary value but donâ€™t shop regularly.
* Strategy:
Offer exclusive, high-end services such as VIP customer care or personalized recommendations.
* Use luxury incentives like early access to premium products or concierge services to keep them engaged.
* Send occasional but high-impact offers tailored to their past purchase history.
  
**Cluster -2 (Frequency Outliers) â€“ "Frequent Shoppers"**
  
* Characteristics: These buyers shop often but spend less per transaction. They are highly engaged but could benefit from increased order values.
* Strategy:
Introduce bundled deals, discounts on bulk purchases, or tiered loyalty rewards to encourage larger transactions.
* Offer subscription models or membership programs that provide perks for higher spending.
Use cross-selling and upselling tactics by suggesting complementary products based on their buying habits.

**Cluster -3 (Monetary & Frequency Outliers) â€“ "VIP Champions"**

* Characteristics: The most valuable customersâ€”frequent buyers with exceptional spending habits. They contribute significantly to overall revenue and require top-tier engagement.
* Strategy:
Develop exclusive VIP programs with special rewards, invitations to private sales, and early product access.
* Provide priority support, personalized shopping experiences, or even dedicated account managers.
* Surprise them with unexpected perks (e.g., birthday gifts, personalized thank-you notes) to strengthen brand loyalty.
  
**Updated Cluster Names & Summary:**

* Cluster -1 (Monetary Outliers) â†’ "Elite Spenders" (Focus on premium services & personalized engagement)
* Cluster -2 (Frequency Outliers) â†’ "Frequent Shoppers" (Encourage upselling & higher basket sizes)
* Cluster -3 (Monetary & Frequency Outliers) â†’ "VIP Champions" (Reward & retain ultra-valuable customers)

#### Labeling the Customer

```python
cluster_labels = {
    0: "Loyal Retainers",     # High-value, regular buyers â€“ focus on retention
    1: "Dormant Re-Engage",   # Low-value, infrequent buyers â€“ needs reactivation
    2: "Growth Potential",    # Recent buyers with low spending â€“ nurture for higher engagement
    3: "Top Performers",      # High-value, high-frequency buyers â€“ top-tier loyalists
    -1: "Elite Spenders",     # Infrequent but high-value spenders â€“ personalize premium offerings
    -2: "Frequent Shoppers",  # Regular buyers with lower per-purchase spending â€“ upselling opportunities
    -3: "VIP Champions"       # Highest-value and most engaged customers â€“ maintain exclusivity
